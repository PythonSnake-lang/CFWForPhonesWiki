What is custom firmware?
===================================
Custom firmware (“CFW”) is a full software modification
to your phone, comparable to “administrator access” on 
a computer. It allows you to do anything that the phone
is physically capable of doing, rather than being limited
by whatever the phone company allows you to do.
